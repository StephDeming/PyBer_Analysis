# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
Summary of ride-sharing data organized by city type in order to understand the relationship between rural, suburban and urban areas, number of fares and number of drivers in those areas.

## Results

- Urban cities have four times the amount of drivers than suburban cities. 
- Of the three areas rural has the highest average fare per driver and ride as well as the least amount of drivers.

## Summary
After running this analysis it would be my recommendation that the rural areas get more coverage. It's hard to say definitively because the driver to ride ratio is really high. However the rates ae also higher than the suburban and rural areas, meaning the trips must be longer so the driver would be out of commission duting those times. 
In April there was a massive dip in fares in the urban areas as well as a smaller but significant dip in suburban. Digging deeper into that would be beneficial, it could be catastrophic were it to become a pattern. 
The best suggestion to give would be to expand upond this data and run the client wait times for rides, ride distance/duration as well as ride acceptance by driver percentages in the three types of areas. That would give a much better idea of what would need to happen here.
